    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      The John Wayne casserole is a hearty and satisfying dish that's sure to
      please everyone at your table. Despite the name, the John Wayne Casserole
      wasn't popularized by the actor himself, but by a fundraiser cookbook
      "Cooking with Love from Cara and Her Friends" and the University of
      Mississippi Medical Center.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Biscuits:</strong> This convenient dinner starts with a can of
        refrigerated biscuits.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Beef:</strong> You'll need a pound of ground beef for this meaty
        casserole.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Taco seasoning:</strong> Use store-bought taco seasoning or make
        your own with our DIY recipe.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Vegetables:</strong> Sliced onions and bell peppers are sautéed
        together, while sliced tomatoes are layered with the other ingredients.
        Jarred jalapeños, meanwhile, spice things up a bit.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Sour cream and mayonnaise:</strong> A mixture of sour cream and
        mayonnaise is creamy, tangy, and adds tons of welcome riches.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cheese:</strong> Because isn't everything better with shredded
        Cheddar cheese? You could use shredded Pepper Jack if you like a little
        extra heat.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the crust:</strong> Press the biscuit dough in the bottom
        and up the sides of a prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven
        until lightly browned.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the beef until crumbly. Drain the
        fat, stir in seasoning and water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat
        and simmer. Transfer the meat to a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cook the veggies:</strong> In the same pan, cook the sliced
        onions and peppers until tender.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Make the creamy layer:</strong> Combine the sour cream, mayo,
        1/2 of the Cheddar, and 1/2 of the cooked veggies in a bowl.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Layer and bake the casserole:</strong> Layer the meat, tomatoes,
        onion-pepper mixture, jalapeños, and sour cream mixture on top of the
        biscuit dough. Sprinkle it with cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until
        the cheese is browned and bubbly.
